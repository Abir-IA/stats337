# Stats 337: Readings in Applied Data Science

[Stats 337](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=stats+337&collapse=%2C2%2C) is a small discussion class available to Stanford students in Spring 2018. In this class you will read 3-4 papers (or equivalent) per week, write a brief response, and then we'll discuss the papers (and underlying ideas) in class.

## Readings

These readings reflect my personal thoughts about applied data science, and are skewed towards topics that I think are important but are generally under appreciated. It is not a systematic attempt to survey the field. That said, if you think there's something major that I've missed, please feel free to submit [an issue](https://github.com/hadley/stats337/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/hadley/stats337/edit/master/README.md)!). It's likely that these readings will evolve as the quarter goes by. 

Many of the readings come from [Practical Data Science for Stats](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/), a join PeerJ collection and special issue of the American Statistician. Jenny Bryan and I pulled this collection together in order to publish some of the important parts of data science that were previously unpublished.
