# Stats 337: Readings in Applied Data Science

[Stats 337](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=stats+337&collapse=%2C2%2C) is a small discussion class available to Stanford students in Spring 2018. In this class you will read 3-4 papers (or equivalent) per week, write a brief response, and then we'll discuss the papers (and underlying ideas) in class.
