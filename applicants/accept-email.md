Hi!

Thanks for applying to take Stats337: I'd love to have you in my class. I appreciate your interest knowing very little about the class, and I now have a syllabus with more information available: https://github.com/hadley/stats337#readings. 

Please read the syllabus through, and if you do still want to take the class:

1.  Register using permission number: {num}

2.  Fill out https://goo.gl/forms/Dsz286pUg3msNm2g2: I'll share this
    only within the class so we can learn each others' names. (Let me 
    know if you don't want to share your information this way and we 
    can make alternative arrangements)
  
3.  Prepare for class by reading https://m.signalvnoise.com/c6371885f7f6:
    this should only take a couple of minutes. If you're bored this week
    feel free to read the optional readings for week 1.
  
If you can no longer take the class, no hard feelings, just let me know
as soon as possible so I can pass on your slot to someone else.

Thanks, and looking forward to meeting you next week!

Hadley
